##This is a basic real-time chat application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface starts with a simple form where users can enter their name to join the chat. The design features a stylish background and a clean, user-friendly layout. Once a user joins, they are taken to a chat room where they can send and receive messages instantly. This project is ideal for learning how to manage user input, work with events in JavaScript, and structure a frontend interface.
